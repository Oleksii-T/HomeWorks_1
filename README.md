# HomeWorks
C language. 07/11/2016 - 29/12/2016

This repository contains 7 independent home works I did on Programming and Algorithms course of my 1-semester study
at Czech Technical University in Prague.

All of these were made on Ubuntu using 'gcc' (version 4.8.4) compiler. That was the very first programming experience I had. 

Task description, sample runs, and submission results are included in the end of each code in the end as a comment.
