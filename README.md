# HomeWorks
C lang

This repository contains 7 independent home works I did on Programming and Algorithms course of my 1-semester study
at Czech Technical University in Prague.

All of these were made on Ubuntu using 'gcc' (version 4.8.4) compiler. That was the very first programming experience I had.
